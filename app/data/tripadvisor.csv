mattmoda,4,5,Mar 2025,Family,Incredible boutique hotel,"One of the most incredible hotels I have ever stayed at. Extremely friendly and accommodating staff which looked after every detail to make your stay incredible. They can do excursions as well. We are from the East Coast, United States and had no difficulty with communication at all. Would completely tell friends without reservation to go here. They will not be disappointed.",,"Christian de Boer|Owner|What a lovely review and we are more than happy that your experience with us warrants the title 'incredible Boutique Hotel'.

Genevieve A,10,5,Mar 2025,Couples,Memorable!,"Our stay at the Jaya House was absolutely fantastic! A lovely room with a balcony overlooking the pool. The gardens and landscaping is lush and well attended. The staff was so polite and were always ensuring we were enjoying our stay. We booked the Angkor Wat through the hotel and our guide was Sopheara Pheav. He was very knowledgeable and, if we are lucky enough to return to Cambodia, we will be requesting him. The hotel spa and dining room are really good. If you are looking for a beautiful, boutique hotel with attentive staff in Siem Reap, look no further than the Jaya House!",,Christian de Boer|Owner|I am so happy to read that you deem our little hotel 'Fantastic'! I can only agree with you with regards both our teams here at Jaya House & your comment about your guide; He is indeed also amazing.

Wendy,1,5,Mar 2025,Couples,"Fabulous, fabulous place.","What a fabulous place. If you want to be treated like a VIP from the moment you arrive to literally the moment you leave (I have just been treated to a complimentary and delicious cappuccino and cookies as I’m waiting in reception for the ride to the airport), there is really nowhere better. I could talk about all the extra amenities - complimentary minibar, tuk tuk rides, two swimming pools - but it’s quicker for you to look them up online. The real difference is the staff - from the owner and management right on - they are charming, friendly, delightful people for whom nothing is too much trouble. And all this in tasteful, luxurious surroundings. You really will not find better.",Ideally situated for Angkor Wat and all the other temples.,"Christian de Boer|Owner|What a lovely review to wake up to. It's always so rewarding when we have been able to showcase the best of Khmer hospitality mixed with our 'no nickel & dime' approach.

Amy G,15,5,Mar 2025,Family,Incredible stay at Jaya House,"We travelled for four nights to Jaya House as a family of six (four adults and two teen boys). We have travelled extensively for both work and pleasure and can easily say this was one of the best hotels we have stayed (even better than Four Seasons service). The staff were some of the kindest people we have met and did everything possible to make us comfortable. So much has been mentioned in other reviews but would love to highlight a few things: The pool is refreshing and great for doing laps. Delicious food and drinks available at the onsite restaurant. Loved the personal coffee and drink bar in the lobby with cookie jars filled for snacking. Incredible massages daily with beautiful surroundings. Staff anticipated every need - cool towel when you arrived back, fresh water, personalized tuk tuk service, bug spray. Our teens boys also raved about the staff and kept commenting 'everyone is so nice here'. My husband arrived at the hotel quite ill from our time in Thailand and the staff took such good care of him. Making special ginger broth, delivering electrolytes, checking in on him, and ensuring us that healthcare was available if needed. Every company who strives to deliver personalized client experiences should come and stay at Jaya House. It felt genuine in every instant. Thank you for a wonderful introduction to beautiful Cambodia. We hope to return one day soon!","Lean on the hotel staff for ideas for outside restaurants, shopping tips, and excursions. It was very helpful to have their input.","Christian de Boer|Owner|It's making me rather happy to know that we have been able to deliver an 'incredible experience' for the 6 of you. We believe that it's always the small details that make any (hotel) experience a good one. Ranking us above one of the global hotel chains in terms of service makes me super happy and proud of the team's daily achievements.

swannythemoose,138,5,February 2025,,Best hotel we stayed at during our trip.,"This was our favourite hotel that we stayed in during our trip. Words cannot adequately describe how brilliant this hotel was. We arrived late in the evening, feeling very tired and there was a glass of wine and a sandwich given to us as they thought we might be hungry. The staff were absolutely brilliant. We had a lovely room and the facilities at the hotel were first class. Transport was complimentary, to take us anywhere we wanted and we were given a phone to use for when we wanted to be picked up.

susanmpassoni,6,5,March 2025,,Wonderful property to escape the hustle and bustle of Siem Reap.,"We stayed at the Jaya House for three nights - it was delightful. A very attentive staff and a lovely hotel layout, making the choice of where to hang challenging. Try the Sky bar for a cocktail or the spa for a fabulous massage. After a long day of cycling and touring the many amazing sights, it’s a great reprieve. The food was also very enjoyable. Would highly recommend!!",,"Christian de Boer|General Manager|Hi Susan, Thank you so much for your wonderful review!

Peter M,1,5,March 2025,,Contemporary oasis in the center of Siem Reap,"The Jaya House was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. The beautiful, contemporary hotel is a surprisingly private refuge in the center of Siem Reap. The rooms are spacious and well appointed with luxurious baths and an outside patio next to a waterfall. The hotel is impeccably maintained with fresh cut flowers everywhere. The staff is extremely attentive. You never have to open a door, you are greeted with a smile and 'lotus hands' by the staff every time you encounter them, and when you return to the hotel, you are greeted with a wet towel. A barista is staffed to make your coffee (for free) starting at 4am. Looking forward to coming back soon.",,"Christian de Boer|Owner|Good afternoon, Thank you very much for the effort made to wrote down your experience with us.

Maxmac,5,5,March 2025,,A real gem,"Stayed this March for 2 nights at this independent luxury boutique hotel in Siem Reap. The perfect base for exploring Angkor Wat and the region. The hotel itself is run independently and offers a level of service unparalleled anywhere I have found for a long while. Literally nothing was too much in terms of service, from the welcome every time we arrived back to the hotel to every departure. The little touches every day demonstrated a real passion to ensure a beautiful stay and every member of staff could not have done more to ensure our comfort. The food was excellent, the spa was excellent. The room was excellent and beautifully designed. A wonderful gem.",,"Christian de Boer|Owner|Good evening from Siem Reap, Thank you for both taking the time to write down your experience with us & choosing Jaya House as your hotel in Siem Reap.

Everywhere there is great attention to detail: from the fresh folded flowers to the outstanding culinary choices, luxurious rooms, tranquil gardens and sincere and polite greetings at every turn.

Simon aus Zürich,3,5,March 2025,,Jaya Hotel the starting point to an unforgettable visit to Siem Reap and Angkor Wat.,"Jaya topped our expectations with view to hospitality, courtesy, attendance to personal requirements and preferences from arrival to departure. Arrangements to explore the city of Siem Reap, its hidden spots as well as the visit of Angkor Wat can be entrusted to the competent staff. We highly recommend Tom as a guide for the visit to Angkor Wat. Not only his knowledge about Combodian history and culture but his competence to navigate thru the numerous tempels explaining details and specific aspects to each of them is just great.",,"Christian de Boer|Owner|Good evening from Siem Reap, It's making me rather happy to know that we have been able to 'top your expectations' since thats been our complete goal.

,,5,March 2025,,Brilliant stay,"Not sure what I could write differently to all the previous reviews as it was a superb stay which everyone seems to experience when they stay at this hotel. Staff totally make the place and a special shout out for Finn at the front desk. The establishment seems to operate to the highest possible standards under impressive leadership. Our room was immaculate and had everything you could need including a free mini bar. We overlooked the smaller of the swimming pools which was ideal for anyone wanting to find a quieter shady spot. We took up the offer of a daily one hour massage, which was complementary and felt totally chilled out by the end of our stay. The hotel also organised a guided tour with a brilliant English speaking guide called Tom. He was so knowledgeable and engaging, and spoke perfect English. We’d highly recommend using Tom as he knew how to find viewpoints and at what timings to visit the temples to avoid the large parties, he really made it an unforgettable experience. Included in that day was a set menu meal at the hotel which was delicious and very high-quality, as was the breakfast every day. The hotel also recommended a couple of excellent restaurants and we particularly liked Jomno. The hotel organises a free tuk tuk service to take you to the restaurants and anywhere else you want to go around town, and also provide a cell phone so that you can just call when you want to be picked up; absolutely brilliant! At the hotel, don’t miss happy hour in the sky bar which was very good. The other point to note is that the hotel offers a free limitless daily laundry service which was so helpful with the sweltering heat at the temples.",,"Christian de Boer, General Manager|Hi Patricia, Thank you so much for your wonderful review of Jaya House! We are thrilled to hear that you had a brilliant stay with us. Your kind words about our staff, especially Finn at the front desk, truly mean a lot to us. We pride ourselves on delivering high standards, and it's fantastic to know that our efforts have not gone unnoticed. We’re glad you enjoyed the room, the peaceful view of the pool, and the complimentary massage. It's great to hear that Tom provided you with such an engaging and informative tour experience, and we appreciate you recommending him to other guests!

,,5,March 2025,,99% perfect,"Service was perfect, everything from the tuktuk drivers, maids, front desk and servers were absolutely amazing. Pools, bars and easy access to the town made our stay easy and pleasant. They make a real effort to be environmentally conscious so it is easy to rest knowing you are limiting your footprint on the world while traveling; which is very hard to do. Only complaint would be that at one point, when I tried to go to the pool, there were no lounge chairs available. Other than that, perfect.",,"Christian de Boer, General Manager|Hi Aaron, Thank you so much for your wonderful review!

,,5,March 2025,,Five plus Stars,"We were greeted by the manager at dinner in a restaurant in Siam Reap far from the hotel he explained his passion to stop using plastic water bottles, making their own botanicals for bug spray to shampoo. Every time we reentered the hotel we were met outside by someone holding a tray of cool towels neatly rolled and smelling of jasmine or similar floral scent. The decor, art and landscaping are all world class stunning and understated. Words are inadequate to explain how kind all the staff is. Money can’t buy the genuine smiles on each of their faces. Everyone was so attentive to anything we might want. We were pampered in a serene oasis that surpasses any luxury hotel we ever stayed in. Don’t hesitate to come to this spectacular small hotel with only 36 rooms.",,"Christian de Boer, General Manager|Hi Robert, Thank you so much for your glowing review!

,,5,March 2025,,Five star experience,"We can’t recommend this hotel enough…gracious doesn’t begin to describe the service. Welcoming and responsive staff, hands on management that ensures guests needs are met swiftly and efficiently. Grounds, common areas and rooms are thoughtfully and beautifully designed. Convenient tuktuk service at a moment’s notice and complimentary amenities including massage and room mini bar are a dream come true! The food is fresh and delicious - and they bake all their own bread. Most impressive is this hotel is a social enterprise, training and employing local residents in an elevated five star hotel.
